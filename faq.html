A high P/E ratio could mean a stock's price is high compared to its earnings possibly meaning the company is overvalued. For example, Tesla's p/e ratio is 1,265, indicating that the company is more than likely overvalued.
    <h4> Beta: A measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. If a beta value is over 1, it's more volatile compared to the market and if it's below 1, it's less volatile compared to the market. For example, a beta value of 1.12 means the share is 12% more volatile compared to the market. </h4>
